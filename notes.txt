step1: Argument validation:

1. correct call:
	./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file 2 -> argc == 5
2. check file1 exists and can be read
3. check file2 can be created/truncated and written to
4. any check fails should print an error and exit gracefully

step2: Command Path Discovery

1. when you type ls -l the shell finds the actual executable file /bin/ls
	it does this by checking every directory in the environment variable PATH
	For the program we need to do the same for both cmd1 and cmd2
	Thats why we'll build *get_cmd_path(char *cmd, char **emvp);
2. what will this function do:
	1. Extract the PATH variable from emvp
	2. Split it by : into directories
	3. Append cmd to each directory (/usr/bin/ls, bin/ls, etc)
	4. Use access(path, X_OK) to check if it's executable
	5. Return the first valid full path
